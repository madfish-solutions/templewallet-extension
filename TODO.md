### IDEAS
- Fees, paid in gas
- - Especially, when tx is a gas transfer
- Clickable asset symbol
- - Take user to asset page
-

### ISSUES
- NFTs are not obvious
- Approve amount
- - Unsetting approval (false in ApprovalForAll for ERC721)
- Getting contract address & asset ID
- - Maybe make asset symbol clickable
- Classification for operations. Same?
- 'Show more/less' button logic
- `TransferSingle` of ERC-1155
